# Sign-Language-Detection
Sign language is the only tool of communication for the person who is not able to speak and hear anything. Sign language is a boon for the physically challenged people to express their thoughts and emotion. In this work, a novel scheme of sign language recognition has been proposed for identifying the alphabets and gestures in sign language. With the help of computer vision and neural networks we can detect the signs and give the respective text output.
